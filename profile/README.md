## Lofticries Games

👋 We're a small team that develops games.

🎯 The main goal pursued by our team is to develop games that show that it is possible to create unique products in different epics of game design.
🎮 For these purposes, our team is developing an unprecedented game engine for Apple platforms that literally every “housewife” could master.

👔 Projects that have been developed:
